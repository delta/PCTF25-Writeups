Memoria Obscura

Alex Raynor, a brilliant but eccentric mathematician, vanished without a trace after claiming he had cracked an unbreakable code. 
When investigators combed through his last known workstation, they found a memory dump filled with fragments of his work. 
Whispers of a protected archive and a script capable of unlocking secrets spread among those curious enough to dig deeper.
Itâ€™s said Alex loved puzzles, layering his secrets in ways only the cleverest could uncover. 
Can you follow his trail and reveal the truth he tried so hard to hide?
